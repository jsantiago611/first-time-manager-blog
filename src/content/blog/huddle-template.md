It can take a first time manager over an hour to write a clear and inviting huddle invite email, especially when you don't know your team well.

...but that's if you're doing it from scratch.

Or, you could use this email template and send a clear invite in the next 5 minutes:

This is a quick 30-minute daily meeting where we can all come together to discuss our priorities, identify any potential blockers, and collaborate on solutions.
